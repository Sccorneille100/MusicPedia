# Music Library

## Description
The purpose of this project is to create a full-stack application where the user can search up their favorite music artist and it will display a list of the artist and whoever they collaborated with. Using JWT authentication, the application will have a login and register page where users can use their email to login. 

The front-end portion is being implemented with react and the back-end is utilizing MongoDB and mongoose for saving search results in the database as well as GraphQL. To retrieve data about artist, this application is using the Last.fm API.
